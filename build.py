Clambering men in big bad boots
Dug up my den, dug up my roots.
Treated us like plasticine town
They built us up and knocked us down.
From Meccano to Legoland,
Here they come with a brick in their hand,
Men with heads filled up with sand,
Let's build.
Let's build a house where we can stay [ba ba ba ba build]
Add a new bit everyday [ba ba ba ba build]
Let's build a road for us to cross [ba ba ba ba build]
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots [ba ba ba ba build]
Whistling men in yellow vans
They came and drew us diagrams.
Showed us how it all worked out
And wrote it down in case of doubt.
Slow, slow and quick, quick, quick
It's wall to wall and brick to brick
They work so fast it makes you sick
Let's build.
Let's build a house where we can stay [ba ba ba ba build]
Add a new bit everyday [ba ba ba ba build]
Let's build a road for us to cross [ba ba ba ba build]
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots [ba ba ba ba build]
Oh, build.
It's build________________
It's build________________
Down with sticks and up with bricks
In with boots and up with roots
It's in with suits and new recruits
It's build...it's build
Let's build a house where we can stay [ba ba ba ba build]
Add a new bit everyday [ba ba ba ba build]
Let's build a road for us to cross [ba ba ba ba build]
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots [ba ba ba ba build]
Let's build a house where we can stay [ba ba ba ba build]
Add a new bit everyday [ba ba ba ba build]
Let's build a road for us to cross [ba ba ba ba build]
Build us lots and lots and lots and lots [ba ba ba ba build]
